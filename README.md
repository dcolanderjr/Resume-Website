Not the fanciest of things, but its more of a proof of concept. Completed using Terraform, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This was fun, but frustrating. Alot of back and forth with the terraform set up regarding CloudFront.
Everytime I would deploy, I'd always get this XML error, and after scouring the internet for hours upon hours, I'd fix, then break, fix then break. It came down to a piece of my code that I was using to deploy the OAC(origin access control)
was misconfigured.

Anyway, here's the link to the site, enjoy!
